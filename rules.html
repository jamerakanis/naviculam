				Naviculam?
			</h1>
			<p class="intro">
				Naviculam National Park. The pinnacle of boats. That’s where we got our park name: the Latin for boat is naviculam! We house all sorts water activities, so make sure to give us a visit! It’s always a pleasure! And by the way, if you’re not interested in water activities, keep in mind that we still have sights on land that you’ve simply gotta see!
			</p>

				Sustaining the Green!
			</h1>
			<p class="intro">
				All of our materials and assets are local, saving us from the affect jet fuels have on our environment. For example, all our rentable bikes are from Kona, here at Canada. We ban littering, obviously to protect our wildlife and vegetation, but we have gone far beyond in placing litter bins all over the park.
				<br/><br/>
				We allow fishing, with consent, but we protect them, and do not allow the killing of any fish. We believe that just because a fish is not endangered, it shouldn’t be protected. We are aware of the killing of whales in other countries. Whales are common in Canada, but are endangered. Fortunately, in Canada, we do not face the problem of people killing them. However, since this a problem in other countries, such as Japan, we teach and inform our younger generations about this issue. We do not want it to grow in anyway. It is already big enough on its own.
				<br/><br/>
				Our litter-free rules are intended to sustain our ecozone in the Taiga shield. We will not risk anything. These rules are in place to promote litterless lunches. We recommend packed lunches, with as little litter as possible. We can all pitch in to help 
			</p>
			<h1 class="head">
				Rules and Regulations
			</h1>
			<p class="intro">
				We do not have many rules, but we only ask that the following conditions be followed:
			</p>

				<li>It is possible to stay overnight in the park but permission is required, and all documents must be shown when requested.</li>
				<li>During all overnight stays, an adult must be present. Supplies can be provided on request.</li>
				<li>Consent is required for all water activities, including fishing.</li>
				<li>Fish caught are to be released.</li>
