				In our park for have lodges for overnight campers and guided night tours with camping for enthusiasts wanting to enjoy an untouched Canadian night sky. Some things you can enjoy are treetop trekking, with a 400 metre zip line over one of our many lakes. You can sail in the summer months and enjoy both summer fishing and winter ice fishing with our trained staff keeping a watchful eye over you. If you want some sport, worry not. We have diving in the summer and cross country skiing in the winter months with our top of the line Skevik skis. If hiking is not to your liking you can rent one of our many bikes. All bikes are provided by our neighbour right here from Kona (the Stinky and Operator). For people wanting to learn about the vast outdoors we have our trained staff giving lessons for everything from sailing to biking and skiing. You can go trekking at Hawke island and enjoy a large variety of wild birds and experience the raw, preplexing beauty.
